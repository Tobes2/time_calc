# time_calc
calculates time
(actually, converts minutes to hours, days, weeks, and years)
just something i wrote for fun

v0.1: does the thing
time taken (s):
10: 0
1000: 0.001
1000 000: 0.005
1000 000 000: 5.1
10 000 000 000: 52.4

v0.2: the old one goes minutes to hours, hours to days, etc. the new one goes minutes to years, then leftover mins to weeks, then mins to days, etc. should be quicker
time taken (s):
